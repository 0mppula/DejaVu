# Déjà Vu

[Déjà Vu][1] is a simple finance themed memory card game with a turn counter and a timer created using React and TypeScript.

The goal of this small project was to learn how to use [TypeScript][2] and [styled components][3] together.

This application was inspired by The Net Ninja's "Magic Match" game, which he created in one of his YouTube [videos][4].
